### About This Project
**Invimtory** is a mock **sales and inventory system** for any business that requires detailed inventory control and organizes customer and customer sales information.


The idea for **Invimtory** came from a previous warehouse job where several large item kits were packaged and shipped daily. Each item kit could contain anywhere from 5 to 20 individual items, all varying in quantity and size.
